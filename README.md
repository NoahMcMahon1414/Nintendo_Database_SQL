This is the repository for my Nintendo video game database that I did for my final project in my INFO 330 class at the University of Washington in fall quarter 2023.

This repository includes:
- All of the raw data for the database in Excel files
- Two drawio files for the ERD and relational schema for the database
- A preliminary proposal document for this project
- SQL file for table creation and data dump
- SQL file for the database queries
- The final project LaTex file
